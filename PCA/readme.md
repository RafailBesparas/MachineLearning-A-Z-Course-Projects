# Case Study
Each feature gives a certain information about a wine. This belongs to wine merchant with many bottles to sell. First we will perform clustering to identify the diverse segment of customers grouped by similarities which corresponds to the wines they prefer. 
The owner also wants to reduce the complexity of this dataset by ending up with a smaller amount of features. So the new task will be to apply the predictive model for any new wine added to the dataset and with less dimensions predict the customer segment. Then we will be able to recommend the wine to the right customer.
