# Case Stydy
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on specific applicant and loan-related features. By analyzing historical data and patterns, the model will assist in making accurate and data-driven decisions, streamlining the loan approval process and reducing the risk of errors.


# Workflow
1. Get the data
2. Clean and Explore the data (Pre-process)
3. Check which labels the algorithm needs
4. Encode the data if necessary
5. Split the data into test and train
6. Fit the data into the model (Model Training)
7. Use the model for prediction based on the test set
8. Check the accuracy of the model
9. Improve - Optimize the model
